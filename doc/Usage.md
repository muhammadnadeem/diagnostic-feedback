Introduction
-------------

In Buzzfeed style quiz, an author can create an assessment quiz with multiple
choice questions. The results for this assessment are defined as categories,
which are assigned against choices for each question. When a choice is selected
as the answer to a question, the respective category gets a +1 score. In the end,
the category with the highest score is concluded as the final result and is
displayed to the student as a feedback to her quiz choices.

The authoring supports creation of interleaved sub-quizzes through association
of the categories and subsequently the related questions to a user-defined group(s).
This allows the author to provide feedback to the students on more than one particular
dimension. Tangibly, this results in the aggregation of feedback for each group at the
end of the quiz. This will hopefully become clear with an example later in this document.


Following is a step-by-step explanation of the authoring process:

    In order to author a Buzzfeed-Styled quiz, first select the ‘diagnostic-feedback’
    from the list of [Advanced] under [Add new component]:
