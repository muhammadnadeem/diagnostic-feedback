Groups
=======

A new group can be simply added and attached simultaneously to a
category by typing the desired name in the group field and clicking
the ‘+’ button that appears next to it:

    See [Categories Group]  (img/result-group-1.jpg)
                            (img/result-group-2.jpg)
                            (img/result-group-3.jpg)

    1.  Enter the group name here
    2.  If the group doesn’t exist, a ‘+’ button will appear
    3.  Once a group is attached, the name will be displayed here.
        If no defined group is attached, it will revert to ‘Default Group’.
        This can be done by just removing the current group from the field
    4.  If the group exists, it will be displayed in an auto-complete list
        and can be selected directly

For the next step note that we have assigned ‘Group 1’ to ‘Monarch’ and ‘Swallowtail’.
Once at the questions, we assign each question to one of the groups that we have assigned
to categories in the previous step.

    See  [Question Group] (img/question-group-1.jpg)

Now you can see that only the groups that were assigned to at least one of the categories
are visible. Groups that were n’t assigned like ‘G Test’, ‘Group 3’ and even the ‘Default Group’
are not available for selection. This prevents assigning questions to an empty group.
Now when we select ‘Group 1’ for QUESTION 1:

The available categories are those which were assigned ‘Group 1’. This practically allows the
author to create completely independent sub-quizzes within each quiz. A question belonging to a
particular group will only increase the score of categories within that group. This leads to
multiple results, one against every single group that has been assigned to at least one category.
Now we can save the quiz after selecting ‘Group 2’ for ‘QUESTION 2’. This will leave us with only
one category ‘Elfin’ for all the choices in the second question.
