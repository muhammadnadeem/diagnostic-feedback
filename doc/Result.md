Adding Categories
==================
Now you are on step 2 screen to define your categories (results): 

see [categories](img/result-1.jpg)
                (img/result-2.jpg)
                (img/result-3.jpg)


1.  Category Name (for internal use only, not visible to students)
2.  Image Url (Can use both relative edX links or absolute HTTP links)
3.  Group Title (Only one group can be added or attached to each category,
    more on this later)
4.  Notes (for internal use only, not visible to students)
5.  Description (HTML displayed as the result if respective category is
    calculated as the final feedback)
6.  Delete Category (If there is only one category left, it cannot be deleted)
7.  Add Category
8.  Drag collapsed categories to order them with their priority in case of a
    tie-breaker in results
