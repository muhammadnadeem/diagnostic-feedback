Questions
=========

These are the two types of questions that can be added to Diagnostic Feedback

1.  Adding the diagnostic-feedback to your course.
2.  Click [Edit] to bring up the quiz editor popup. Enter the same title
    question as the Quiz title (for analytic purposes). Select ‘BuzzFeed-style’
    in the [Quiz Type] drop-down. Another thing to note here is that once set,
    this type cannot be changed during subsequent edits of this Quiz.
